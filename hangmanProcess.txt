OBJ: 
This program will allow the user to play hangman against the computer using a list of words from a txt file.
-A fuctions that randomly selects a word from the text dictionary
-A function that takes input from the user that will be each letter guessed
-A fuction that will take the letters guessed correctly and turn them into a string
-We need to create the various variables to store the users inputted data
        -We need a variable for the word the computer picks
        -We need a set fo data that holds the letters guess wrong and the letters guessed right
-We need to display an intro to the program
-We need to build a repeatitive system, so the user can keep guessing letters
-If the player guesses wrong, a new part of the body will appear, until they lose
-We need to display an outro for the program

    # open the words dictionary
    
    # penerate a random index
    
    # print out the word at that index

    #this function gets a letter guess from th user
    
def generate_word_string(word_letters_guessed)
    # this fuction generates the word display that shows which letters the user has guessed correctly
    
    output = []
    for letter in wor:
    if letter is guessed, add it to output
    else, add a _
    
    ruturn the output as a string

    #check if user already guessed that letter
    
    #check if guess was correct
    
    #print how much of the word is guessed and how many letters are left
    
    #tell the user they have won or lost
